# Covid-19-EDA

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has had a worldwide effect. On March 11 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic, pointing to over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world at the time.

I have used Pandas NumPy and Pandas for Data Analysis as well as Matplotlib, folium and Plotly for visualization and graphs. 

# Data

Data is in CSV format and updated daily. It is sourced from this upstream repository maintained by the amazing team at Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) who have been doing a great public service from an early point by collating data from around the world.
 
This dataset includes time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

- Confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
- The number of people who have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus
- The number of people who have reportedly recovered from it
